# Detecting Malware and Unauthorized Devices

This repository contains the lab work for "Detecting Malware and Unauthorized Devices". The lab aims to understand security risks associated with rogue devices and malware by learning active and passive scanning techniques, as well as crafting, deploying, and detecting malware.

## Lab Overview

### Objectives

- Perform active and passive scanning using Nmap.
- Detect rogue devices on the network using active and passive tools.
- Craft, deploy, and detect malware.

### Tools Used

- **Wireshark**: A protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic.
- **Zenmap**: A GUI front end for Nmap used for scanning open ports and services.
- **Metasploit**: A framework containing various exploits for information systems.
- **Nmap**: A port scanner used to determine whether ports are open or closed on a remote system.

### Key Terms

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A network protocol designed for end-to-end data packet delivery over the Internet.
- **ifconfig**: A Linux command-line tool to configure network interfaces.

## Lab Instructions

### Part 1: Finding Rogue Devices

#### Tools: arp-scan and Nmap

- **arp-scan**: Used for system discovery and fingerprinting by sending ARP requests to specified IP addresses.
- **Nmap**: Used for active, passive, and hybrid scanning to locate rogue devices on the network.

### Part 2: Active, Passive, and Hybrid Scanning with Nmap

- **Active Scanning**: Nmap sends packets to all hosts on a network or subnet and waits for responses.
- **Passive Scanning**: Nmap examines packets sent from other nodes on a network or subnet.
- **Hybrid Scanning**: Nmap sends initial packets and then uses passive scanning to search for responses from the target host.

### Part 3: Wiresharkâ€”Capturing Packets

- **Wireshark**: Used to inspect and capture packets on the network to discover rogue systems.

### Part 4: Crafting, Deploying, and Detecting Malware

- **Kali Linux/Metasploit**: Used for penetration testing and creating malware.
- **DarkComet**: A remote access Trojan used to craft malware that can be detected by Windows Defender.

## Detailed Steps

### Determining Network Ranges

1. Use `ifconfig` to view network interfaces and IP addresses.
2. Identify network segments and their respective IP ranges.

### Active and Passive Scanning

1. Use `ping` to verify connectivity.
2. Use `arp-scan` and `zenmap` to find rogue devices.
3. Save and analyze scan results.

### Capturing and Analyzing Packets with Wireshark

1. Use Wireshark to capture network packets.
2. Identify rogue systems based on captured data.

### Crafting and Deploying Malware with DarkComet

1. Create a malware payload using DarkComet.
2. Deploy the malware and detect it using Windows Defender.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you will learn how to use active and passive scanning techniques to detect rogue devices and craft malware that can be detected by security software.
